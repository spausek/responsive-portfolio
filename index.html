	<p> Hello world! Isn’t that what we’re supposed to say in our first website? Anyway, my name is Kyle Cohen and I’m excited to present my first completed website! This is a real accomplishment for me considering I actually sat down and finished it early instead of ADHDing out and waiting for the last minute but I can catch up on the latest memes later. I’m originally from Philadelphia but have lived in San Diego and most recently Sacramento. My wife and I moved to Los Angeles 6 months ago since UCLA offered her a position as a Professor of Medicine.

	<p>I worked in Biotech for 8 years. I took a lab support job, making simple buffers and reagents, in my freshmen year of college but was quickly moved to Cell Culture since growing rat tissues in a dank windowless laboratory seemed like the perfect job for a socially awkward ginger. Since I got that job I dropped out of college which may have either been the worst or best decision of my life. I later met my wife in the Broyest Bro bar in all of San Diego, got married packed up the dog and, well nothing else was really important, then moved to Sacramento where she completed her academic fellowship, not the fun Hobbit one, at UC Davis.  I’m excited to learn web development since our lives are becomingly increasingly spent online whether it’s spent accessing online libraries that contain the sum total off all human knowledge or arguing with a 12 year about which generation of Pokémon was best, it’s the first, no contest like seriously Klefki is just a key chain…a key chain. </p>
